This is a work in a progress for a simple emacs mode, that
will automatically detect graph specifications in a dot syntax
and display them using overlaying.

Currently available:

- `dot-display` command will insert a picture of a graph, specified in 
   a given region.

- `dot-display-at-point-backward` search backward for a first occurence
   of a graph specification and insert its image at the point.
